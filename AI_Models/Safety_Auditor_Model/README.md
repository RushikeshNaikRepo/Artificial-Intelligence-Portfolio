🛡️ SafetySense AI: The Automated Worksite Inspector
What is this?
SafetySense AI is a smart tool I built to help construction and warehouse managers keep their teams safe. Instead of someone having to manually check every photo or video for safety gear, this AI does it automatically. It "looks" at a picture of a worksite and instantly tells you if people are wearing their helmets and vests, or if there are any dangerous trip hazards on the floor.

Why I built this
In big industries, safety is the number one priority, but it’s hard to monitor every corner of a site at once. I wanted to create a simple, easy-to-use app where a manager can upload a quick photo and get an objective "Safety Audit" in seconds. It’s about using modern AI to prevent accidents before they happen.

Key Features
Instant PPE Detection: Automatically checks for hard hats, high-visibility vests, and safety glasses.

Hazard Spotting: Identifies messy walkways, blocked exits, or risky behavior.

Safety Scoring: Gives the site a simple grade from 1 to 10 so you know exactly how risky the situation is.

Record Keeping: You can download the AI's findings as a text file to keep for your daily safety reports.

The Tech Behind It
Brain: Powered by Google Gemini 3 Flash (a cutting-edge AI that can "see" and "reason").

Body: Built using Streamlit, which turns Python code into a clean, interactive website.

Language: Written entirely in Python.

How to Use It
Open the live link.

Upload a photo of your workspace or construction site.

Click "Run Safety Audit".

Review the score and findings, and download the report if you need to save it!
